The function checks if the input array is empty and returns empty string if empty
i initiallize an empty string `commonItems`
i iterrate over the characters of the first string using the for loop to check if the same character is in the same position in all other strings.
if it is then add the character to the commonItems.
move to the next cahracter and repeat the previous process again.
if all characters are not thesame, stop and return the commonItems
i checked with console.log to display the output
